Facebook Reels is [Meta's answer to TikTok](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/bringing-reels-to-facebook/) — short, engaging videos that rack up millions of views daily. But just like TikTok, Facebook doesn't make it easy to download Reels to your phone.

**Want to save a Facebook Reel right now? Use our free [Facebook Video Downloader](/facebook-downloader) — paste the link and download in seconds.**

Whether you want to save a hilarious clip, keep an inspirational video, or back up your own Reels, this guide shows you every method available.

## Why Download Facebook Reels?

- **Offline viewing** — Watch your saved Reels without internet, perfect for flights, commutes, or areas with poor signal.
- **Content repurposing** — Creators can download their own Reels to repost on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram.
- **Archiving** — Facebook content can disappear if the creator deletes it or their account gets deactivated. Downloading preserves it.
- **Sharing outside Facebook** — Send a video to someone who doesn't have Facebook, via WhatsApp, text, or email.

## Method 1: MediaTools Facebook Downloader (Fastest)

The simplest method — works on iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac.

### Step 1: Find the Reel

Open the Facebook app or website and find the Reel you want to download.

### Step 2: Copy the Link

- **On mobile:** Tap the **three dots** (⋯) on the Reel → **Copy link**
- **On desktop:** Right-click the Reel or click the three dots → **Copy link**

### Step 3: Download

1. Go to [MediaTools Facebook Downloader](/facebook-downloader).
2. Paste the Facebook link into the input box.
3. Click **Get Video**.
4. Choose your preferred quality and click **Download**.

The video saves directly to your phone's camera roll or your computer's Downloads folder. No account needed, no fees, no watermark added.

## Method 2: Facebook's Built-in "Save Video" (Limited)

Facebook lets you "Save" videos within the app:

1. Tap the three dots on any video → **Save video**
2. Find it later in **Menu** → **Saved**

**However, this has major limitations:**
- The video is only accessible within the Facebook app
- You can't share it outside Facebook
- If the original creator deletes it, your saved copy disappears too
- You can't edit or repurpose the video

**Verdict:** Fine for bookmarking, but doesn't actually download anything to your device.

## Method 3: Browser Developer Tools (Desktop Only)

Tech-savvy users can sometimes extract video URLs through browser developer tools:

1. Open the Reel in Chrome
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the **Network** tab
4. Filter by "media" and look for `.mp4` requests
5. Copy the URL and open it in a new tab to download

**Drawbacks:**
- Complicated and time-consuming
- Doesn't work if Facebook uses encrypted streams
- Desktop-only (impossible on mobile)
- Breaks frequently with Facebook updates

**Verdict:** Too complicated. Use [MediaTools](/facebook-downloader) instead.

## Method 4: Third-Party Apps (Risky)

Various apps claim to download Facebook videos. Most come with serious problems:

- **Ad overload** — Free apps are typically funded by aggressive advertising
- **Privacy concerns** — Some apps require your Facebook login, which is a major red flag
- **Malware risk** — [Google and Apple regularly remove](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13326042) video downloader apps for policy violations
- **App store removals** — These apps frequently get banned, leaving you without a solution

**Verdict:** Too risky. A browser-based tool like MediaTools is safer because it never asks for your login credentials.

## How to Download Facebook Reels on iPhone

iPhone users often struggle with video downloads because iOS restricts file downloads. Here's the exact process:

1. Copy the Reel link from the Facebook app
2. Open Safari and go to [getmediatools.com/facebook-downloader](/facebook-downloader)
3. Paste the link and click **Get Video**
4. Tap **Download** — the video will appear in your **Files** app
5. Open Files, find the video, tap it, then tap the **Share** button → **Save Video**
6. The Reel is now in your Camera Roll!

> **Tip:** On iOS 16+, downloaded videos may go directly to your Photos app without needing the Files app step.

## How to Download Facebook Reels on Android

Android makes it slightly easier:

1. Copy the Reel link from the Facebook app
2. Open Chrome and go to [getmediatools.com/facebook-downloader](/facebook-downloader)
3. Paste the link and tap **Get Video**
4. Tap **Download** — the file saves to your Downloads folder
5. Open your Gallery app — the video should appear automatically

## Can I Download Facebook Live Videos?

Yes, but only **after** the Live broadcast has ended and been saved as a regular video. While a broadcast is live, it can't be downloaded. Once it's converted to a regular video post, you can use the same [Facebook Downloader](/facebook-downloader) process.

## What About Private Videos or Groups?

Our tool can only download **public** videos. If a video is posted in a private group or on a private profile, it's not accessible to external tools — and for good reason.

Respecting privacy is important. Only download content that's been shared publicly.

## Is It Legal to Download Facebook Reels?

- **Personal use:** Generally fine. Saving a video to watch offline is widely considered acceptable.
- **Reposting others' content:** Don't pass off someone else's content as your own. Always credit the original creator.
- **Commercial use:** Requires permission from the content creator and potentially from any music rights holders.
- See [Facebook's Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) for their full content usage policy.
