Twitter (now [X](https://x.com)) is full of viral clips, breaking news footage, and hilarious moments you want to keep forever. But the app has no built-in download button.

Here are the 5 best methods ranked from easiest to most effort.

## Method 1: MediaTools (Fastest & Easiest)

This is the simplest way — no apps, no extensions, just your browser.

### How to Save Twitter Videos on iPhone
1. Open the Twitter/X app and find the video.
2. Tap the **Share icon** → **Copy Link**.
3. Open Safari and go to [MediaTools Twitter Downloader](/twitter-downloader/).
4. Paste the link and tap **Get Video**.
5. Tap **Download**.
6. **Crucial Step:** Tap the **AA** or **Downloads icon** in the address bar → **Downloads** → Tap the video → **Share** → **Save Video**.

### How to Save Twitter Videos on Android
1. Copy the tweet link.
2. Open Chrome and visit [MediaTools Twitter Downloader](/twitter-downloader/).
3. Paste the link and tap **Get Video**.
4. Tap **Download**. The video will automatically appear in your Gallery.

Works on PC and Mac as well. The video saves directly to your device in MP4 format.

## Method 2: Browser Bookmark Trick

Some users create a browser bookmark with JavaScript that extracts the video URL. While this works occasionally, it breaks every time Twitter updates their site — which is frequently.

**Verdict:** Unreliable. Use MediaTools instead.

## Method 3: Browser Extensions

Desktop extensions like "Twitter Video Downloader" add a download button to tweets. The downsides:

- They often contain **trackers and ads**.
- They don't work on mobile.
- Chrome frequently [removes them from the Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/) for policy violations.

**Verdict:** Risky and desktop-only.

## Method 4: Screen Recording

You can screen-record the video playing on your phone. But you'll get:

- Lower quality (compressed by screen capture).
- The Twitter UI overlaid on the video.
- Audio from notifications interrupting the recording.

**Verdict:** Last resort only.

## Method 5: Third-Party Apps

Various apps on the App Store and Google Play claim to download Twitter videos. Most are filled with ads, require subscriptions, or get removed for violating platform policies.

**Verdict:** Not worth the risk. A browser-based tool like [MediaTools](/twitter-downloader/) is safer and faster.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I download Twitter GIFs?**
Yes! Our [Twitter downloader](/twitter-downloader/) handles both videos and GIFs. GIFs on Twitter are actually MP4 files, so they download as video.

**Does this work with tweets from private accounts?**
No. You can only download videos from public tweets. Private/protected tweets require the author's permission.

**What about Twitter Spaces recordings?**
Twitter Spaces that have been recorded by the host can sometimes be downloaded, but it depends on how Twitter serves the audio. Our tool works best with standard video tweets.

**Is downloading Twitter videos legal?**
Downloading for personal use is generally fine. Don't repost someone else's content as your own or use it commercially without permission. See [X's Terms of Service](https://x.com/en/tos) for their full policy on content usage.

## The Bottom Line

[MediaTools](/twitter-downloader/) is the fastest, safest way to save Twitter videos. No apps to install, no extensions to manage, no screen recording hassle. Just paste the link and download.

Try it now — it's completely free.
