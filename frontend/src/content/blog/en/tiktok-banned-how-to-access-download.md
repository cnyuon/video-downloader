## How to Save Your TikTok Content

Regardless of where you live, having backup copies of your favorite content is always smart. Here's how:

### Save Individual Videos

1. Open TikTok and find the video you want to keep.
2. Copy the link (tap **Share** → **Copy Link**).
3. Go to [MediaTools TikTok Downloader](/tiktok-downloader).
4. Paste the link and download — videos save **without a watermark** in HD.

### Extract Audio from TikToks

Love a particular TikTok sound? Use our [TikTok Sound Downloader](/tiktok-sound-downloader) to save the audio as an MP3 file you can keep forever.

### Back Up Your Own Posted Content

If you're a creator, back up your own videos:
1. Go to your TikTok profile.
2. Copy the link for each video you've posted.
3. Download clean copies through [MediaTools](/tiktok-downloader).

This way, even if the platform becomes unavailable in your region, you still have all your content.

## How to Access TikTok from Restricted Regions

If TikTok is fully banned in your country, a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is the most common way users regain access. A VPN routes your internet traffic through a server in another country.

### What to Look for in a VPN

- **Speed** — TikTok is video-heavy, so you need fast servers that don't buffer.
- **Server locations** — Pick a VPN with servers in countries where TikTok works (Japan, UK, Singapore are reliable).
- **Mobile app quality** — You'll primarily use TikTok on your phone.
- **No-log policy** — Your browsing data should stay private.

Popular options include [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/), [Surfshark](https://surfshark.com/), and [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/). Do your own research to find the best fit for your needs and budget.
