TikTok is home to millions of viral sounds — from catchy songs to hilarious audio clips and trending voiceovers. But the app doesn't give you a way to download just the audio.

Whether you want to use a trending sound in your own videos, save a song you discovered on TikTok, or just listen offline, this guide covers everything you need to know.

## Why Download TikTok Sounds?

There are tons of reasons people extract audio from TikTok:

- **Use trending sounds in your own content** — Grab the original audio to use in video edits across platforms like [YouTube Shorts](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10059070) or Instagram Reels.
- **Discover new music** — TikTok is the #1 music discovery platform. Many songs go viral on TikTok before hitting mainstream. Save them before they disappear.
- **Create ringtones** — Turn your favorite TikTok sounds into custom phone ringtones.
- **Offline listening** — Save sounds to listen when you don't have internet access.
- **Podcasts and voiceovers** — Some creators share valuable audio content that's worth keeping.

## Method 1: MediaTools TikTok Sound Downloader (Easiest)

This is the fastest method — works on any device with a browser.

### Step 1: Find the TikTok Video

Open TikTok and find the video with the sound you want. It can be any public video.

### Step 2: Copy the Link

Tap the **Share** button (the arrow icon) → **Copy Link**. The link is now on your clipboard.

### Step 3: Download the Audio

1. Go to [MediaTools TikTok Sound Downloader](/tiktok-sound-downloader/).
2. Paste the TikTok link into the input box.
3. Click **Get Video** — our tool will extract the audio automatically.
4. Click **Download as MP3**.

That's it! The audio file saves directly to your device. No app installation, no account creation, no watermarks on the audio.

## Method 2: Download Video First, Then Extract Audio

If you also want the video along with the audio:

1. Download the video using our [TikTok Video Downloader](/tiktok-downloader/) (no watermark).
2. Use our [Video to MP3](/video-to-mp3/) tool to extract the audio from the downloaded video.

This two-step method gives you both the clean video file AND the audio file.

## Method 3: TikTok's Built-in "Save to Music" (Limited)

TikTok lets you "Add to Favorites" for some sounds, but:

- You can only listen within the TikTok app
- You can't download the audio file
- If the sound gets removed from TikTok, it disappears from your favorites too
- Not all sounds are available to save

**Verdict:** Fine for in-app use, but doesn't actually download anything.

## Method 4: Screen Recording Audio (Not Recommended)

You could screen-record while a TikTok plays, then extract the audio. But:

- Quality is significantly worse (compressed twice)
- You'll capture notification sounds and background noise
- It's slow and manual
- The resulting file is much larger than a direct MP3 download

**Verdict:** Only use this as an absolute last resort.

## Tips for Finding TikTok Sounds

- **Tap the spinning disc** at the bottom-right of any TikTok to see the sound's name and all videos using it.
- **Search by lyrics** if you don't know the song name — TikTok's search understands lyrics.
- **Check the "Sounds" tab** in TikTok Search for trending audio.
- **Save sounds to favorites first** so you have them bookmarked before downloading.

## What Audio Quality Can I Expect?

TikTok compresses audio, so the quality won't be lossless CD-quality. Here's what you'll typically get:

| Method | Quality | Format |
|---|---|---|
| MediaTools Sound Downloader | Good (128-192 kbps) | MP3 |
| Video + MP3 extraction | Good (128-192 kbps) | MP3 |
| Screen recording | Poor (variable) | M4A/MP3 |
| TikTok in-app favorites | Streaming only | N/A |

For most use cases — ringtones, personal listening, video editing — the quality from our tool is more than sufficient.

## Is It Legal to Download TikTok Sounds?

Downloading for **personal use** is generally fine. However:

- **Don't redistribute copyrighted music** commercially without proper licensing.
- **Original creator audio** (voiceovers, original sounds) belongs to the creator. Use with respect and credit when sharing.
- **Trending songs** are typically owned by record labels. Using them in personal projects is usually fine, but monetized content may get flagged by platforms' content ID systems.
- See [TikTok's Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) for their full policy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I download any TikTok sound?**
Yes, as long as the video is public. Our tool extracts the audio track from the video itself, so any sound playing in a public TikTok can be downloaded.

**Does this work on iPhone?**
Absolutely. Our [TikTok Sound Downloader](/tiktok-sound-downloader/) works in Safari and Chrome on iOS. No app needed — the MP3 file saves directly to your Files app.

**Can I use downloaded TikTok sounds in my own videos?**
For personal, non-commercial use, generally yes. If you're creating monetized content, be careful with copyrighted music — platforms like YouTube may flag it via Content ID.

**What's the difference between TikTok Sound Downloader and Video to MP3?**
The [TikTok Sound Downloader](/tiktok-sound-downloader/) extracts audio directly from a TikTok link in one step. The [Video to MP3](/video-to-mp3/) tool works with any video file or URL from multiple platforms — it's more versatile but requires a video source.

**Can I download the original full song, not just the TikTok clip?**
No — our tool downloads the audio exactly as it appears in the TikTok video. TikTok clips are usually 15-60 seconds. For the full song, check streaming platforms like [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) or [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/).
