TikTok is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, filled with creative and entertaining videos. However, when you try to download a video directly from the app, it comes with a bouncing watermark that can cover important parts of the video.

In this guide, we'll show you how to download TikTok videos **without the watermark** in high definition, completely for free.

## Why Download TikToks Without Watermark?

- **Reposting to other platforms:** If you're a creator, you might want to share your content on [Instagram Reels](https://help.instagram.com/270447560766967) or [YouTube Shorts](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10059070). Most algorithms deprioritize videos with watermarks from other apps.

- **Editing:** Use clips for reaction videos or compilations without the distracting logo bouncing around.
