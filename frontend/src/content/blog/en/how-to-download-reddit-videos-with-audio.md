Have you ever found a hilarious video on Reddit, tried to save it or text it to a friend, and realized it transferred as a completely silent video?

You aren't going crazy. The "Reddit no sound bug" when saving or sharing videos has frustrated users for years. 

To understand why this happens, and how to easily fix it by downloading the video directly, read on.

## Why Do Reddit Videos Download Without Sound?

The reason why saving a video from the Reddit app often results in a silent clip is because of how Reddit processes media on its backend servers.

Unlike Twitter or TikTok which encode a single `.mp4` file containing both pictures and sound, Reddit's video player (formerly known as v.redd.it) relies on a format called DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP).

When a user uploads a video to Reddit, the system separates the file into **two different streams**:
1. A video-only stream
2. An audio-only stream

When you watch a post on the app, the Reddit video player quickly stitches these two streams back together on your screen so it looks and sounds normal. 

However, when you press "Save Video" on your phone, the app often only processes the video stream, ignoring the audio stream completely. The result? A perfectly crisp, entirely silent meme.

## How to Download Reddit Videos with Sound

Since the native app is unreliable, the best way to ensure you get the full media file is to use an external downloader that knows how to stitch the audio and video streams together before handing you the file.

While MediaTools specializes in platforms like [Twitter](/twitter-downloader), [TikTok](/tiktok-downloader), and [Facebook](/facebook-downloader), the process for downloading Reddit videos works similarly across the most popular free web tools. 

Here is exactly how you do it:

### Step 1: Copy the Reddit Post Link
Open the Reddit app or website and find the video you want to save. 
- Tap the **Share** button (the swooping arrow) located beneath the post.
- Select **Copy Link**.

*(Note: It must be a post hosted directly on Reddit. If the post is a link out to a YouTube video, you will need a YouTube downloader).*

### Step 2: Use a Video Downloader
Open a web browser on your phone (like Safari or Chrome) and go to a free web downloader tool. Because you are doing this in the browser, it works perfectly on iPhone, Android, Mac, or PC.

Paste the Reddit link you just copied into the site's input box.

### Step 3: Select Your Quality & Download
The tool will analyze the link, pull *both* the video DASH stream and the audio stream, and combine them into a standard MP4 file. 

Usually, the tool will give you options for video quality (e.g., 720p or 1080p). Select the highest available resolution and tap **Download**.

The MP4 file will now be saved directly into your device's downloads folder—with crystal clear audio entirely intact.

## Can You Download NSFW Reddit Videos?

It depends on the tool you are using. Because of the mature content filters in place, many popular video parsing APIs block requests for URLs ending in NSFW or restricted subreddits. 

If you are trying to download an age-restricted video and the downloader throws an error, you may need to find a tool specifically designed to bypass Reddit's NSFW gating.

## A Note on Reddit GIFs

Sometimes, what looks like a video on Reddit is actually a GIF. 

If you try to save a Reddit post and you cannot hear any sound—even after using an external downloading tool to stitch the streams—it is highly likely the original uploader posted the file as a GIF (which does not contain an audio track by definition). 

Always double-check the post to see if there is a tiny speaker icon with an "X" next to it in the corner of the video player. If there is no speaker icon at all, it's a GIF!
