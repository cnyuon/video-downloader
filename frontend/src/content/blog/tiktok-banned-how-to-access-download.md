## How to Access TikTok from Restricted Regions

If TikTok is already banned in your area, a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is the most reliable way to access it. A VPN routes your internet traffic through a server in a different country, making it appear as if you're browsing from that location.

### What to Look for in a VPN for TikTok

- **Speed:** TikTok is video-heavy. You need fast servers that won't buffer.
- **Server locations:** Choose a VPN with servers in countries where TikTok is available (Japan, UK, Singapore, etc.).
- **Mobile apps:** You'll primarily use TikTok on your phone, so the VPN needs a solid iOS/Android app.
- **No-log policy:** Ensure your browsing data stays private.

### Recommended VPNs for TikTok Access

Here are some well-known options to consider:

| VPN | Speed | Server Count | Price | Best For |
|-----|-------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **NordVPN** | Very Fast | 6,000+ servers | ~$3/mo | Overall best pick |
| **Surfshark** | Fast | 3,200+ servers | ~$2/mo | Budget-friendly |
| **ExpressVPN** | Very Fast | 3,000+ servers | ~$7/mo | Reliability |
