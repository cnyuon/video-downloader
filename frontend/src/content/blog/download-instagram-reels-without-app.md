Instagram Reels are short, engaging videos that often go viral — and sometimes you just need to save one. Maybe it's a recipe, a workout routine, or a clip that makes you laugh every time.

**Save any Reel instantly with our free [Instagram Downloader](/instagram-downloader). No app required.**

Unfortunately, Instagram doesn't offer a native download button for Reels. Here's how to get around that.

## Why Save Instagram Reels?

- **Repurpose content:** Creators often want to cross-post Reels to TikTok or YouTube Shorts. Algorithms penalize content with other platforms' watermarks, so downloading cleanly matters.
- **Offline viewing:** Save videos for flights, commutes, or areas with poor signal.
- **Editing and compilations:** Use Reels clips in your own edits, reaction videos, or compilations (with credit, of course).

## How to Download Reels (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Copy the Reel Link

Open the Instagram app, find the Reel you want to save, and tap the **three dots (⋯)** in the bottom right corner. Then tap **Link** → **Copy Link**.

Alternatively, you can use the **Share** button (paper airplane icon) and select **Copy Link** from the share sheet.

### Step 2: Paste into MediaTools

1. Go to [MediaTools Instagram Downloader](/instagram-downloader).
2. Paste the link you just copied.
3. Click **Get Video**.

### Step 3: Download

Once the video preview loads, tap the **Download** button. The Reel will be saved to your phone's gallery or your computer's downloads folder.

That's it — three steps, no app install, no account needed.

## Tips for iPhone Users

On iOS, downloaded videos go to your **Files** app by default when using Safari. To save directly to your Camera Roll:

1. Open the **Files** app.
2. Find the downloaded video.
3. Tap the share icon → **Save Video**.

Alternatively, use Chrome on iOS — it handles video downloads more intuitively.

## Tips for Android Users

Android saves downloads directly to your **Downloads** folder or gallery. Most Android browsers (Chrome, Samsung Internet) handle video downloads seamlessly.

## Can I Download Instagram Stories?

Instagram Stories are trickier since they expire after 24 hours and have different URL structures. Our tool currently focuses on **Reels and regular video posts**, which cover the most common use case.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does this work with private accounts?**
No. Our tool respects privacy settings. You can only download content from public profiles.

**Can I download Instagram photos too?**
Our tool is optimized for video content (Reels, IGTV, video posts). For photos, a screenshot or the built-in bookmark feature works fine.

**Will the creator know I downloaded their Reel?**
No. Downloading through an external tool does not notify the content creator.

**Is this legal?**
Downloading public content for personal use is generally fine. Always credit creators if you repost, and never claim someone else's content as your own.

## Wrap Up

Saving Instagram Reels doesn't require downloading sketchy apps or browser extensions. Our [Instagram Downloader](/instagram-downloader) works directly in your browser, on any device.
