## What is MP3 Juice?

Originally, "MP3 Juice" (or MP3Juices) was an incredibly popular web-based search engine for audio. It allowed users to search for a song title or artist, and the site would scour the internet to find an open directory or server hosting that audio file. It would then provide a direct download link to save the `.mp3` file to your computer or phone.

However, like LimeWire, Napster, and countless other file-sharing services that came before it, the original site was eventually targeted by copyright enforcement agencies and shut down.

Because the brand name was so highly recognizable, dozens of "clone" sites immediately popped up using the same layout, same name, and slightly different domain names (like `.cc`, `.to`, `.icu`, etc.).

## Are MP3 Downloader Sites Safe?

**The short answer is: Usually no.**

Because the original site no longer exists, the clones that operate today are often run by anonymous entities looking to monetize massive amounts of search traffic quickly. To do this, these platforms heavily rely on aggressive ad networks.

When using one of these unverified converter sites, users frequently encounter:
* **Pop-under ads:** Clicking a seemingly innocent "Search" or "Download" button opens a hidden window in the background.
* **Fake download buttons:** The page may display three or four large, bright green "Download" buttons that are actually deceptive advertisements, not the file you want.
* **Malware and adware redirects:** You may be redirected to pages warning you that your device is infected—a scare tactic to get you to install malicious "antivirus" apps.

If you are not using a robust ad-blocker and strict antivirus software, trying to download a simple song can easily result in device infections or compromised data.

## The Safe Alternative: Extracting Audio from Video

If you want to save a specific viral song, a funny voiceover, or a cover performance, the safest method is to find the video on a major social platform (like TikTok or Twitter) and extract the audio track yourself using a secure, ad-free web tool.

For example, if you hear a great remix playing in the background of a TikTok video, you don't need to risk searching for it on shady third-party indexing sites. You can simply rip the audio directly from the source video.

Here is how you can safely extract audio using the clean, free **[MediaTools Video to MP3 Converter](/tr/video-to-mp3/)**:

1. **Find the Video:** Locate the video containing the audio you want on TikTok, Twitter/X, or Facebook.
2. **Copy the Link:** Tap the "Share" button and select "Copy Link".
3. **Paste & Convert:** Go to the [Video to MP3 Converter](/tr/video-to-mp3/) on MediaTools, paste your URL, and click **Get Info**.
4. **Download:** The server securely extracts only the audio track from the media file. Click download to properly save the MP3 directly to your device.

Because MediaTools is built securely without aggressive pop-ups, fake buttons, or weird redirects, it is infinitely safer than navigating the murky waters of music pirating clones.

## Can You Use Extracted MP3s as Ringtones?

Yes! One of the most popular reasons people extract audio from TikTok videos or Twitter clips is to make custom alarm tones and ringtones. 

Once you have downloaded the MP3 file securely using our tool:
* **On Android:** Navigate to Settings > Sound > Ringtone > Add Ringtone, and select the MP3 file you downloaded.
* **On iPhone:** You will need to use the free Apple GarageBand app to import the downloaded MP3, convert it into a designated Apple Ringtone file, and export it to your settings.
